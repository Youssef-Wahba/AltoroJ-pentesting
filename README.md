# AltoroJ Security Report and Mitigation Guide

This repository is focused on performing penetration testing on the AltoroJ application, identifying vulnerabilities, and applying mitigations to secure the application.

## Project Overview

AltoroJ is a vulnerable web application that is often used for educational purposes in cybersecurity. This project aims to perform a comprehensive security assessment of AltoroJ and provide a detailed report along with the steps to mitigate identified vulnerabilities.

## Prerequisites

- [Apache Tomcat 8](http://tomcat.apache.org/download-80.cgi) installed on your machine.
- [Java Development Kit (JDK)](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html) installed on your machine.
- [Burp Suite](https://portswigger.net/burp) installed on your machine.
- Basic knowledge of penetration testing and common web application vulnerabilities.

## Setting Up AltoroJ

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Youssef-Wahba/AltoroJ-pentesting.git
   cd altoroj-security
   ```

2. Download and install [Apache Tomcat 8](http://tomcat.apache.org/download-80.cgi).

3. Deploy the AltoroJ application:

   - Copy the `altoroj.war` file into the `webapps` directory of your Tomcat installation.
   - Start the Tomcat server by running the `startup.bat` (Windows) or `startup.sh` (Unix) script located in the `bin` directory of your Tomcat installation.

4. Access the AltoroJ application at `http://localhost:8080/altoroj`.

## Performing Penetration Testing

### Tools

- [Burp Suite](https://portswigger.net/burp)

### Common Vulnerabilities to Test For

1. **SQL Injection**
2. **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**
3. **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)**
4. **Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR)**
5. **Security Misconfigurations**
6. **Sensitive Data Exposure**

### Steps

1. **Reconnaissance**: Gather information about the application, such as URLs, parameters, and functionality.
2. **Scanning**: Use Burp Suite to scan for vulnerabilities.
3. **Exploitation**: Attempt to exploit identified vulnerabilities to understand their impact.
4. **Reporting**: Document each vulnerability, its impact, and steps to reproduce it.

## Security Report and Mitigations

Refer to the `Security Report.pdf` file in this repository for detailed information on identified vulnerabilities and their mitigations.

## Mitigation Steps

The `Security Report.pdf` contains detailed steps to mitigate each identified vulnerability. Implement the recommended changes in the codebase to secure the application.
